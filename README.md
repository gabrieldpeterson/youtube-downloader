# YouTube Downloader
This will download the highest quality file available from the YouTube URL you provide, and it will place in your Downloads folder.

The first time you run the program you may be prompted with something like:
```
Please open https://www.google.com/device and input code RBST-LJFC
Press enter when you have completed this step.
```
Simply follow the steps Google provides. You should only need to do this once per device.


Run using the command (replace the URL with the desired URL, make sure it is in quotes): 
```
python main.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chQ2OhhNgv8"
```

If you don't supply a URL it will prompt you. In that case don't surround in quotes
